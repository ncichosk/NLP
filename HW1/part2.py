		#	 4. Loop over each sentence in the training data.
		
		#	 	 1. Initialize the hidden state with the start state, move it to the proper device using `.to(device)`, and detach it from any previous computation graph with `.detach()`.
		
		#	 	 2. Call `optimizer.zero_grad()` to clear any accumulated gradients from the previous update.
		
		#	 	 3. Initialize a variable to keep track of the loss within a sentence (`loss`).
		
		#	 	 4. Loop through the characters of the sentence from position 1 to the end (i.e., start with the first real character, not BOS).
		
		#	 	 	1. You will need to keep track of the previous character (at position i-1) and current character (at position i). These should be expressed as numbers, not symbols.
		
		#			2. Call self.step() to get the next hidden state and log probabilities over the vocabulary given the previous character.
		
		#			3. See if this matches the actual current character (numberized). Do so by computing the loss with the nn.NLLLoss() loss initialized above. 
		#			   * The first argument is the updated log probabilities returned from self.step(). You'll need to reshape it to `(1, V)` using `.view(1, -1)`.
		#			   * The second argument is the current numberized character. It will need to be wrapped in a tensor with `device=device`. Reshape this to `(1,)` using `.view(1)`.
		
		#			4. Add this this character loss value to `loss`.

		#			5. Increment `total_chars` by 1.

		#	 	 5. After processing the full sentence, call `loss.backward()` to compute gradients.

		#		 6. Apply gradient clipping to prevent exploding gradients. Use `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_()` with `self.parameters()` and a `max_norm` of 5.0.

		#		 7. Call `optimizer.step()` to update the model parameters using the computed gradients.

		#		 8. Add `loss.item()` to `total_loss`.

		#	5. Compute the average loss per character by dividing `total_loss / total_chars`.

		#	6. For debugging, it will be helpful to print the average loss per character and the runtime after each epoch. Average loss per character should always decrease epoch to epoch and drop from about 3 to 1.2 over the 10 epochs.
